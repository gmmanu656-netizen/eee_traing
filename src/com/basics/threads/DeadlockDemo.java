/*
Points to remember
Thread 1 acquires a lock on accountA and then sleeps,giving
Thread 2 time to acquire a lock on AccountB;
thread 1 waits for Account A& Thread 2 waits for accountB
Scine neither thread releases the lock,both keep waiting for each other creating a Deadlock❌ Situation
✅Deadlock Explanation:Deadlock occurs when each thread is holding
a resource and waiting for the other thread to release it.
➡️When deadlock occurs ,it will not destroy the app,it will freeze it premanently.
HOw to reslove deadlock->Write a better code!!!
