/*
points to remeber
java program stars with one main thread
threads allow parallel
threads share memory
when start() is called the jvm created a new thread
when run() is called directly there is no concurrency
//// process vs thread
process is running a program
thread is a path of execuation
threads share the same memory
creating a thread is cheaper than creating a process
////////examples
process-> google chrome browser
thread -> opening a new tab in chrome
