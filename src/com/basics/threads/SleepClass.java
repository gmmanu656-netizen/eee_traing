/*
code explaniation:
///Intially the Thread is in the new state.
///after calling start().it moves to RUNABLE state and
    it excetute the run () method.
/// the excute timming of state change will depend on the JVM scheluder
///////// points to remeber
// Thread is create only once
// start() change the state
// thread cannot be restored
//final state is dead or terminatee
//////a thread can be created by extending the thraed class and over ride
